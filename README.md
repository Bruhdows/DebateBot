# AI-powered Discord Debate Bot

## Fun, ain't it?

Unfinished, still working on it.

The main command is `/debate`, which will allow you to pick the topic (optionally set the custom starting, reply system prompts).

Make sure to set the `apiKey` and `debateChannelId` in the `config.json`. 

If you wish to use ollama, change `apiType` to `OLLAMA`, set the `apiModel` to ollama model you want to use (make sure to pull it before) and set `apiBaseUrl` (`http://localhost:11434` is the default).
